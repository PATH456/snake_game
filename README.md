A classic Snake game implemented in Python to practice logic, state management, and OOP.

## Features
- Keyboard-controlled snake movement
- Food generation and score tracking
- Collision detection (walls and self)
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows

## Technologies
- Python
- Turtle 

## What I Learned
- Managing game state over time
- Working with coordinates and grid movement
- Handling collisions and game-over conditions
- Writing clean logic for growing game objects

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Clone the repository:
